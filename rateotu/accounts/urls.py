# NOTE: Same AUTH service but different URLS
# NOTE: Permission protecting any of these URLs makes no sense (contradiction).
# JWTs are stateless, when refreshing a token, a user will be of AnonymousUser class,
# therefore endpoint will return 403.
# Since JWTs are managed at the clint level, each application must implement storage,
# expiry, renewal of JWTs, and RBAC. â€” This is a significant, security-sensitive
# responsibility.
# NOTE: All routes on client are 'role' protected.
